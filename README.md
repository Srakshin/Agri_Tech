# FarmerTech Platform

A modern web application for farmers providing smart crop advisory, pest early warning, marketplace, irrigation planning, and knowledge portal features.

## Project Overview

FarmerTech is a comprehensive platform designed to help farmers leverage technology for improved productivity, sustainability, and profitability. The platform includes five main modules:

1. **Smart Crop Advisory:** Get personalized crop recommendations based on soil, climate, and farming goals.
2. **Pest & Disease Early Warning:** Receive alerts about potential pest and disease outbreaks in your area.
3. **Farmer Marketplace:** Buy, sell, and trade agricultural products directly with other farmers and buyers.
4. **Smart Irrigation Planner:** Optimize water usage with AI-driven irrigation scheduling.
5. **Farming Knowledge Portal:** Access a wealth of farming information, best practices, and community wisdom, with voice search capabilities.

## Tech Stack

- React.js for the frontend
- CSS for styling (modular approach with separate CSS files)
- Simulated API services (ready for backend integration)

## Project Structure

```
/components - Reusable UI components
/pages - Page components for each section
/assets - Images and icons
/styles - CSS files for styling
/services - API service functions
```

## Setup and Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm start
   ```

## Usage

Navigate through the different sections of the application:

- Home page: Overview of all features
- Advisory page: Access crop recommendations and pest warnings
- Marketplace: Browse and purchase agricultural products
- Irrigation: Plan and optimize your irrigation schedule
- Knowledge Portal: Search for farming information and best practices

## Backend Integration

The application is set up with simulated API services that return dummy data. To connect to a real backend:

1. Modify the API service functions in `/services/api.js`
2. Replace the dummy data with actual API calls to your backend endpoints
3. Update the data models and interfaces as needed

## Responsive Design

The application is fully responsive and works on various device sizes:

- Desktop
- Tablet
- Mobile

## Future Enhancements

- Real-time weather data integration
- Machine learning-based crop and disease detection
- IoT device connectivity for automated irrigation
- Community forums and farmer networking features
